**Usage:**
  In SLAM systems, the ICP algorithm is usually used in the front-end, i.e. visual odometry, for 3D-3D pose estimation.

**Problem Setup:**
  Given 2 sets of matched 3D points (assuming that we already matched 2 RGB-D images)
  $$ {J(\theta) =\frac{1}{2m} [\sum^m_{i=1}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})2 + \lambda\sum^n_{j=1}\theta^2_j} $$
