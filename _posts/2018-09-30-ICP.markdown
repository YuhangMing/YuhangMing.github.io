#### Usage:

  In SLAM systems, the ICP algorithm is usually used in the front-end, i.e. visual odometry, for 3D-3D pose estimation.

#### Problem Setup:

  Given 2 sets of matched 3D points (assuming that we already matched 2 RGB-D images, details refering to the problem known as *data association / point matching / correspondence finding*):

  $$ \boldsymbol{P} = \{\boldsymbol{p}_1, \boldsymbol{p}_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{p}_n\} $$

  $$ \boldsymbol{P}' = \{\boldsymbol{p}'_1, \boldsymbol{p}'_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{p}'_n\} $$

  We would like to find a transformation $$\boldsymbol{R}$$, $$\boldsymbol{t}$$, such that 

  $$ \forall i, \boldsymbol{p}_i = \boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{p}'_i + \boldsymbol{t} $$
