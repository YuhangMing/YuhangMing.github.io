#### Usage:

  In SLAM systems, the ICP algorithm is usually used in the front-end, i.e. visual odometry, for 3D-3D pose estimation.

#### Problem Setup:

  Given 2 sets of matched 3D points (assuming that we already matched 2 RGB-D images, details refering to the problem known as *data association / point matching / correspondence finding*):

  $$ \boldsymbol{P} = \{\boldsymbol{p}_1, \boldsymbol{p}_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{p}_n\} $$

  $$ \boldsymbol{P}' = \{\boldsymbol{p}'_1, \boldsymbol{p}'_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{p}'_n\} $$

  We would like to find a transformation $$\boldsymbol{R}$$, $$\boldsymbol{t}$$, such that 

  $$ \forall i, \boldsymbol{p}_i = \boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{p}'_i + \boldsymbol{t} $$

#### Solutions:

  Before diving into the solutions, we should notice that camera model (intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera) is not quite relevant when trying to find the transformation between 2 sets of 3D points. 

  In order to find the desired transformation, we first formulate this problem under the leastsquare manner:

  $$ \boldsymbol{R}^*, \boldsymbol{t}^* = \underset{ \boldsymbol{R}, \boldsymbol{t} } {\operatorname{argmin}} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n || \boldsymbol{p}_i - (\boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{p}'_i + \boldsymbol{t})  ||_2^2 $$

  Like any other least square problems, there are 2 methods of finding the optimal transformation: Linear Estimation, and Non-Linear Optimization.
